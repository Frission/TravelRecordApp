# TravelRecordApp
 App made for learning Xamarin
 
 NOTE: As part of the changes, experiences are saved to a database in the Microsoft Azure Cloud, but since this was a test application, my Azure key was free, and it seems to have run out since then, thus this app currently cannot communicate with the cloud. If you're interested in running this app, please contact me. 
 
 I have made this app as part of a Xamarin course I was interested in, but I have switched to learning Native Android development since then.
 
 You can select a nearby point of interest, which is retrieved via FourSquare, and write the experiences you had in that location.
 The experience is currently saved into a local database using SQLite. You can also change your experiences at anytime. Experiences that are recorded on these points of interests will be shown on a map using Google Maps API. The map also shows users own location.
